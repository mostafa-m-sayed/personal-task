This is a clone for Vocabulary App with minimal features.

The new feature i have implemented the the Quiz feature.
Quiz feature: The user can get quizzed for the vocabularies he is learning.
The feature needs improving as this is just a prototype where the quiz is always the same and independent of the actual words that the user has learned.
Also the user can get score points based on his correct answers.

- The feature that i believe needs improvements: The Save feature.
The users usually keep saving and never get back to their saved words.
I believe it should be improved somehow where the user is encouraged to review his saved words and practice them in sentences or maybe stories of the origin of those words.

- A missing feature from the app that would add value would be
Story mode:
    The user can view a story with simple natural language that contains some hard vocabularies. This way, they will be easier to learn and harder to forget.
    It will be like a dialogue between friends (written and spoken to).
